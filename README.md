# Masters Thesis IP-free scripts (drug discovery, ligand-based virtual screening)
Some of the scripts developed in Pharmacelera S.L. for my MSc Thesis *Parametrization of atom-types LogP-based hydrophobic descriptors for virtual screening*. The project was developed within the framework of Pharmacelera S.L. intelecutal property (IP), so only a short representation of the scripts developed can be uploaded to this publicly available repository. 

The scripts TFM_Script1.py, TFM_Script2.py and TFM_Script3.py were utilized in the parametrization stage of the project.
